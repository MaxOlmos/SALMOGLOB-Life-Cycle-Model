# SALMOGLOB-Life-Cycle-Model

A life cycle model considering spatial covariation of marine life history traits of Atlantic salmon populations. 
For a description of the model please, see : Olmos et al., (YEAR), Evidence for a spatial coherence in time trends of marine
life history traits of Atlantic salmon populations in the North Atlantic, currently submitted to Fish and Fisheries


# To run the model 3 files are needed

1. model_cycle_ATL.txt : is the JAGS code used 

2. Data.Rdata : is a list containing all the data needed to run the model. 
Data were collected and compiled by the ICES Working Group on North Atlantic Salmon. The data file is provided here to run the life cycle model. If you want to use it for other projects, please contact WGNAS (hgj@ices.dk) or the Chair of the WGNAS (Martha.Robertson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).
Otherwise, raw data are available in WGNAS Report. (http://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGNAS.aspx).
Finally, if you want to run the model, please be aware that 4 days are needed.

3. Run
