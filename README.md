# SALMOGLOB-Life-Cycle-Model

A life cycle model considering spatial covariation of marine life history traits of Atlantic salmon populations. 
For a description of the model please, see : Olmos et al., (YEAR), Evidence for a spatial coherence in time trends of marine
life history traits of Atlantic salmon populations in the North Atlantic, currently submitted to Fish and Fisheries


 > model.txt : is the JAGS code correponding to the baseline configuration of the life cycle model
 
      * density-independent egg-to-smolt survival relationship with a common homogeneous survival rate among SUs, constant over time and modelled with very low inter-annual stochastic variability (F1 configuration)
      
      * no a priori hypotheses about the covariation structure of 13×13 variance-covariance matrices ∑θ3 and ∑θ4 are made (M1 configuration)
      
      * stock assignement fata based on genetics are used to assign the origin of the catches to SUs, which allows harvest rates to vary by SU (E1 configuration)
